== Local Application Port system
 
Local Application Management system. This application just like MacPorts on Mac
OS X.
An application has some versioned. But we use various version case by case.
For example Ruby application is now moving from 1.8 to 1.9.
So we must build Ruby 1.8 and Ruby 1.9 environment.
localport make us build multiversion environment easyly.
But there is some restrictions, following:

* When you install some application, you must specify one directory.
  Like this, 
    /Users/user/apps
  This directory is called "application directory".

* And, you must specify execute directory. Like this,
    /Users/user/local/bin
  This directory is called "executional directory"

Fox example, let's control Ruby-1.8.7.-p160 with localport.

1) Build, and Install Ruby-1.8.7-p160 to "application directory".
  % tar zxvf ruby-1.8.7-p160.tar.gz
  % cd ruby-1.8.7-p160
  % ./configure --prefix=/Users/user/apps/ruby/ruby-1.8.7-p160

2) Install that to "execution directory"
    % localport install /Users/user/apps/ruby/ruby-1.8.7-p160
  This command make symbolic links that are Ruby applications in
  /Users/user/apps/ruby/ruby-1.8.7-p160/bin.

3) Activate that.
    % localport activate ruby-1.8.7-p160
  This command make installed symbolic ruby-1.8.7-p160 point symbolic link.
    apps/ruby/ruby-1.8.7-p160/bin/ruby
      <- local/bin/ruby-1.8.7-p160
      <- local/bin/ruby

4) Deactivate that. 
  If you want to execute another Ruby version with no specified version
  command, 'ruby'.
    % locaport deactivate ruby-1.8.7-p160
  This command remove symbolic link 'local/bin/ruby'.

== Install

Just easy. Just run rake.
  
  % Rake

== Usage

= install

  % localport install {app}

= installed

To list up installed applications.

  % localport installed [app]

= activate

To activate installed application.

  % localport activate {app}

= deactivate

To deactivate installed application.
Delete internal symbolic link.

  % localport deactivate {app}
